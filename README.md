# BATTERY_ISOLATOR_V1.1_PCB
A prototype 12V RV battery isolator using a STM32F042F6P6 processor, an ACS724 current sensor and a MCP2551 CAN Transceiver 
Intention is to PWM current flow based on max current parameters and voltage differences between the two batteries. 
It will also broadcast both battery's voltage and the charging current over CANbus
